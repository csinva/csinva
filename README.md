### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I'm Chandan, a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley working on interpretable machine learning.

ðŸ¤– I like to explain and play around with machine learning and data science
- [notes/posts](https://github.com/csinva/csinva.github.io) on ml/ai
- [imodels](https://github.com/csinva/interpretability-implementations-demos) package for transparent model fitting
- [gan/vae](https://github.com/csinva/pytorch_gan_pretrained) pretrained demo models
- [paper-title generation](https://github.com/csinva/gpt2-paper-title-generator) with gpt2

ðŸ§  Some of my research focuses on interpreting neural networks
- [hierarchical interpretations](https://github.com/csinva/hierarchical-dnn-interpretations) for individual predictions [ðŸ“„](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05337)
- [penalizing explanations](https://github.com/laura-rieger/deep-explanation-penalization) to put prior knowledge into models [ðŸ“„](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13584)
- [interpreting transformations](https://github.com/csinva/transformation-importance) to understand models in cosmology [ðŸ“„](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01926)

ðŸ“Š And I care about working on serious applied data-science problems
- [covid forecasting](https://github.com/Yu-Group/covid19-severity-prediction) for individual counties and hospitals [ðŸ“„](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07882)
- [validating clinical decision rules](https://github.com/csinva/iai-clinical-decision-rule) for predicting intra-abdominal injury
- [predicting endocytosis](https://github.com/Yu-Group/auxilin-prediction) through cell-imaging videos
