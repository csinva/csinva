### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I'm Chandan, a Phd candidate at UC berkeley working on interpretable machine-learning across domains.

I like to explain and play around with machine learning and data science ðŸ¤–
- [Notes/posts on ml](https://github.com/csinva/csinva.github.io)
- [imodels](https://github.com/csinva/interpretability-implementations-demos): transparent model fitting
- [GAN/VAE](https://github.com/csinva/pytorch_gan_pretrained): demo models
- [paper-title generator](https://github.com/csinva/gpt2-paper-title-generator) with gpt2

Some of my research focuses is on interpreting neural networks ðŸ§ 
- [ACD](https://github.com/csinva/hierarchical-dnn-interpretations) (ICLR, 2019): hierarchical interpretations
- [CDEP](https://github.com/laura-rieger/deep-explanation-penalization) (ICML, 2020): penalizing explanations to improve models.
- [TRIM](https://github.com/csinva/transformation-importance) (ICLR Workshop, 2020): interpreting transformations

And I care about working on serious applied data-science problems ðŸ“Š
- [covid forecasting](https://github.com/Yu-Group/covid19-severity-prediction)
- [cell biology tracking](https://github.com/Yu-Group/auxilin-prediction)
- [validating clinical decision rules](https://github.com/csinva/iai-clinical-decision-rule)
